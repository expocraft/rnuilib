/**
 * Known issues with React Native TextInput component
 * 1. iOS - input inner padding is off in multiline mode
 * 2. Android - input has minHeight that can't be overridden with zero padding (unlike iOS)
 * 3. Passing typography preset that includes lineHeight usually cause alignment issues with
 * other elements (leading/trailing accessories). It usually best to set lineHeight with undefined
